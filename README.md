# Caesar Cipher Program

This repository contains a simple Caesar Cipher implementation in Python. The program allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using a shift cipher.

## Description

The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. This program implements both encryption and decryption functionalities.

The program is implemented using Python's string manipulation capabilities and utilizes if statements, functions, and loops to perform the cipher operations.

## Features

* Simple, text-based interface.
* Encryption and decryption functionality.
* Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
* Clear and concise code structure.
